# Small-math-project
This code is a simple program to perform arithmetic operations and check whether the three entered sides form a valid triangle or not.

A while True loop is used to run the program endlessly. At first, a menu with various options is displayed to the user and then by reading the number from the user's input, it executes the selected program.

In the first choice, the user enters two numbers and the program performs arithmetic operations on them and prints the results. If the input number is not valid, an error message will be printed.

In the second choice, the user enters the three sides of the triangle and the program checks whether these three sides form a valid triangle or not.

In the third choice, the program ends and exits the while loop.
